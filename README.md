Lead Motion version in https://github.com/alexwing/kame-hame-ha-vr


## Updates

- The Kame Hame Ha has a speed proportional to the impulse of the hands.
- The explosion of the lunar terrain was previously done with a bitmap brush, now I use a revolutionized beizer curve, so it has gained precision and customization capacity.
- The size of the terrain of destruction and explosions depends on the size and speed of the kame hame ha.
- The sounds are determined by speed, size and distance of the effects.
- Now when flying with the index finger gesture of your right hand, depending on the position of your hand you can go forwards and backwards proportionally.
- You can now rotate with the index finger gesture of your left hand.
- Add physics to the targets, when a time is exceeded after an impact, the target returns to the original position.
